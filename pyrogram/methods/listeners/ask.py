        """Send a message and wait for the answer to it.

        Shortcut for :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.send_message` followed by
        :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.listen`. The returned update carries the prompt
        as ``sent_message``.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str`` | List of ``int`` | ``str``):
                Chat to send the question to. When a list is given, the question
                goes to the first one and any of them may answer.

            text (``str``):
                Text of the question.

            filters (:obj:`~pyrogram.filters.Filter`, *optional*):
                Extra filter the answer has to pass.

            listener_type (:obj:`~pyrogram.enums.ListenerTypes`, *optional*):
                Kind of update to wait for. Defaults to a new message.

            timeout (``float``, *optional*):
                Seconds to wait before raising ``ListenerTimeout``. Defaults to
                the client's ``listener_timeout`` (300s).

            unallowed_click_alert (``bool`` | ``str``, *optional*):
                For callback query listeners, answer clicks coming from a user
                this listener does not expect. Pass a string to set the text.

            user_id (``int`` | ``str`` | List of ``int`` | ``str``, *optional*):
                User the answer has to come from.

            message_id (``int`` | List of ``int``, *optional*):
                Message the answer has to belong to.

            inline_message_id (``str`` | List of ``str``, *optional*):
                Inline message the answer has to belong to.

            kwargs:
                Any other argument accepted by
                :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.send_message`.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | :obj:`~pyrogram.types.CallbackQuery`:
            The answer, with the prompt attached as ``sent_message``.

        Raises:
            ListenerTimeout: In case nobody answered in time.
            ListenerStopped: In case the listener was stopped, or the client is.
            ListenerLimitReached: In case no listener slot was available.

        Example:
            .. code-block:: python

                answer = await app.ask(chat_id, "What is your name?", timeout=60)
                await answer.reply(f"Hello {answer.text}")

        sent_message = await self.send_message(
            chat_id[0] if isinstance(chat_id, list) else chat_id,
            text,
            **kwargs
