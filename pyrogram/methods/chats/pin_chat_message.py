        You must be an administrator in the chat for this to work and must have the "can_pin_messages" admin right in
        the supergroup or "can_edit_messages" admin right in the channel.

        .. include:: /_includes/usable-by/users-bots.rst

        Parameters:
            chat_id (``int`` | ``str``):
                Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat.

            message_id (``int``):
                Identifier of a message to pin.

            disable_notification (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True, if it is not necessary to send a notification to all chat members about the new pinned
                message. Notifications are always disabled in channels.

            both_sides (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True to pin the message for both sides (you and recipient).
                Applicable to private chats only. Defaults to False.

            business_connection_id (``str``, *optional*):
                Unique identifier of the business connection on behalf of which the
                action is taken.

        Returns:
            :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` | ``None``: In groups and channels the service message is returned.
            In private chats no service message is sent and None is returned.
